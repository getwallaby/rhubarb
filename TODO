* Test coverage of multiple-db situations
* Test coverage of close-and-reopen db situations
* Metadata stored in db files
* Bring code coverage up to 100%
* Documentation
* Standalone examples (i.e. not just "please see the test suite")
* Resolve issues related to using prepared statements
* Find rows by value of blob-valued field
* Automatic zlib compression of blobs (:zblob type)
