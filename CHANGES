version 0.0.4  (180897a77b55400b31d364a08cb9f81c423eb59f)

*  Test suite is mainly stable (individual tests will sometimes hang
   upon creating a QMF agent).
*  This is probably the last version before I change the method call API.

version 0.0.3  (060c7b5bcaa2711b3e3ce511c9c3ecaa59bf0de8)

*  Agent-ready callback and parent-process notification (app.rb)
*  The beginnings of an SPQR test suite

version 0.0.2  (ecd94b141307c5f0f141833836ea686854cfda9c)

*  First shaky pass at automated RPM packaging (see rpmspec and
   srpm rake targets)
*  Automatic find_all methods for Rhubarb persisting classes

version 0.0.1  (0714a87f30469772fc302515e95576e329f7deb9)

*  Gem support
*  Codegen fixes

version 0.0.0  (bbbc2e9d6983f773f6d093a821a0e635714ea869)

*  Initial numbered release; corresponds roughly to the functionality
   from the "Introducing SPQR" blog posts, but with an added Rakefile.
