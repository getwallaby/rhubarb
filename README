SPQR is a tool to automatically generate QMF applications from Ruby
classes, and to automatically generate Ruby classes from QMF schema
descriptions.  (The spqr-gen tool, which provides the latter
capability, is currently in a state of flux due to recent changes in
the SPQR library interface.  It will be functional again soon.)

Rhubarb is a simple persistence layer that stores instances of Ruby
classes in a SQLite3 database.
